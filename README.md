Robots for Urban Search and Rescue - Autonomous UAV Search and Rescue

The unpredictability of humanity and the forces of nature make the world a volatile place. War, terrorist attacks and unfortunate accidents are regular occurrences and all too often put human lives at risk. Similarly the power of nature through tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and storms can result in both displaced and trapped individuals.  These incidents necessitate rescuers entering dangerous environments to help those who cannot help themselves. This however puts the rescuers in danger, as it involves them entering the affected area. 

To avoid putting rescue teams in harms way, robotic systems have been developed to assist with searching of these complex and sometimes fragile environments. However, these systems are often limited to a small set of sensors and cameras that a highly skilled operator must manipulate. Whilst there has been some progress with the development of autonomous systems, these technologies are currently restricted to ground based movement and are often slow in carrying out searches. During these situations time is at a premium and every passing minute lowers the success rate of a safe extraction. 

The objective of this task was to design and implement a technology that will bring the fields of Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) and autonomous UAV technology together. Through the use of image processing and UAV flight manoeuvres, the software intended to enable a UAV to autonomously locate a human figure in a previously unseen environment. Once the target had been located, the UAV would continue to track and follow the target, monitoring its movements.
